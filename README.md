# Assignment_Bigdata
Explore key CS trade-offs (time vs. space, consistency vs. availability, etc.) &amp; evaluate search algorithms (Linear, Binary, Hashing, Tree-Based) for large datasets. Includes Python implementations of MergeSort, random number generation (return vs. yield), &amp; MapReduce insights. Ideal for learning algorithmic efficiency &amp; trade-offs.
